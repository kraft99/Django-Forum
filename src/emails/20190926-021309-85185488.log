Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address edward.mike.anaryo@gmail.com.
Follow the link below:

In case you forgot your Django Boards username: testy

If clicking the link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered
your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't
initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely
disregard this email.

Thanks,

The Django Boards Team
